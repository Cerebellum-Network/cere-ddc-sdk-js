# Migration Plan Diagram Explanation

## Diagram Overview

This flowchart diagram presents the **migration strategy** for transitioning from the current three-SDK architecture to the Unified Data Ingestion SDK/API system. The plan has been streamlined based on key team decisions: SDK-only migration (no data migration required), acceptance of breaking changes, and team control over all applications, resulting in a much faster and simpler migration approach.

## What This Diagram Shows

### Migration Framework

The diagram organizes the migration into **6 streamlined sections**:

1. **Architecture Transition (SDK Only)**: Before and after states with no data migration
2. **Migration Strategy**: Streamlined approach leveraging breaking changes acceptance
3. **Application Update Plans**: Coordinated batch updates rather than complex phased migrations
4. **Risk Management**: Reduced risk profile due to no data migration
5. **Timeline & Support**: Streamlined 11-week timeline vs. 25+ weeks
6. **Implementation Decisions**: Finalized team decisions and success criteria

### Migration Philosophy

The framework demonstrates a **coordinated approach**:

- **Big Bang Replacement**: Direct SDK replacement since breaking changes are acceptable
- **Team-Controlled Environment**: All applications under team control
- **No Data Migration**: Data remains in existing systems, only SDK interfaces change
- **Accelerated Timeline**: 11 weeks total vs. 25+ weeks for complex migrations

## Assignment Requirements Addressed

### Migration Planning

- **SDK Migration Strategy**: Direct replacement approach for SDK interfaces only
- **Reduced Risk Management**: risk profile without data migration concerns
- **Accelerated Timeline**: Realistic 11-week timeline with team coordination
- **Simple Rollback Procedures**: Code revert-based rollback strategy

### Operational Requirements

- **Minimal Disruption**: Breaking changes acceptable since team controls flow
- **No Data Integrity Concerns**: No data migration eliminates data integrity risks
- **Performance Validation**: Focus on SDK performance rather than data consistency
- **Streamlined Support**: Internal team support rather than extensive external support

### Business Continuity

- **Coordinated Updates**: Team can coordinate all application updates simultaneously
- **Communication**: Internal team communication rather than external stakeholders
- **Clear Success Criteria**: Technical success metrics focused on SDK adoption
- **Reduced Contingency Planning**: scenarios due to controlled environment

## Architecture Transition (SDK Only)

### Current State Architecture

**Multi-SDK Landscape (Team Controlled)**:

- **Telegram Apps** → Activity SDK, HTTP API
- **Drone Clients** → Data Cloud SDK, Activity SDK
- **Video Processing** → Data Cloud SDK, Activity SDK

**Current Challenges**:

- **Developer Complexity**: Multiple SDKs to learn and maintain
- **Inconsistent Interfaces**: Different APIs for similar operations
- **Operational Overhead**: Multiple monitoring and support systems
- **Version Management**: Coordinating updates across multiple SDKs

### Future State Architecture

**Unified Interface (Updated Applications)**:

- **All Applications** → Unified SDK/API (Single Integration Point)
- **Updated Applications**: All apps updated to use Unified SDK
- **Same Data Systems**: Data remains in existing backend systems
- **Centralized Control**: Single point for configuration and monitoring

**Future Benefits**:

- **Development**: Single SDK to learn and integrate
- **Consistent Experience**: Same interface patterns across all use cases
- **Operational Excellence**: Unified monitoring and configuration
