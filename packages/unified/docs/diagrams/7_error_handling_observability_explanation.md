# Error Handling and Observability Diagram Explanation

## Diagram Overview

This flowchart diagram illustrates the **finalized error handling and observability strategy** for the Unified Data Ingestion SDK/API system. It shows how the system detects, processes, and recovers from various types of failures in a dual-write architecture while providing complete visibility into system operations, with a focus on simplicity and partial success acceptance for the MVP.

## What This Diagram Shows

### Dual-Write Error Handling Flow

The diagram demonstrates how errors flow through the dual-write system:

1. **Dual-Write Execution**: Orchestrator performs parallel writes to Data Cloud and Index
2. **Result Collection**: System collects responses from both write operations
3. **Error Classification**: System categorizes errors and partial success scenarios
4. **Recovery Strategy**: Simplified recovery approaches based on MVP requirements
5. **Observability**: Enhanced logging and monitoring for dual-write scenarios

### Finalized Error Categories

The system handles three main scenarios with simplified approaches:

#### Transient Errors

- **Definition**: Temporary failures that may succeed on retry
- **Examples**: Network timeouts, temporary service unavailability
- **Strategy**: Simple retry with basic backoff (at-most-once delivery)
- **Recovery**: Limited retry attempts, then error response

#### Permanent Errors

- **Definition**: Failures that won't succeed on retry
- **Examples**: Invalid data format, authentication failures
- **Strategy**: Return error immediately to client
- **Recovery**: No automatic retry, client intervention required

#### Partial Success Scenarios (Acceptable)

- **Definition**: One write succeeds while the other fails
- **Examples**: Data Cloud success + Index failure, or vice versa
- **Strategy**: Accept partial success and return success response
- **Recovery**: Log partial success for monitoring, no compensation needed

## Assignment Requirements Addressed

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-4: Idempotency Support**: At-most-once delivery with correlation IDs
- **Dual-Write Support**: Handles parallel writes to Data Cloud and Index
- **Error Resilience**: Simplified error handling ensures system reliability

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Reliability**: Partial success acceptance improves overall success rates
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced observability for dual-write scenarios
- **Performance**: Simplified error handling minimizes performance impact

### Operational Requirements

- **Debugging**: Correlation IDs enable end-to-end request tracing
- **Alerting**: SLA-focused monitoring aligned with Data Stream Compute requirements
- **Simplicity**: Reduced complexity for MVP implementation

## Finalized Design Decisions

### 1. Partial Success Acceptance

**Decision**: Partial success in dual-write scenarios is acceptable  
**Rationale**:

- **Business Requirement**: Team confirmed partial success is acceptable
- **Reliability**: Higher overall success rate by accepting partial writes
- **Simplicity**: Eliminates need for complex compensation mechanisms
- **Performance**: Reduces latency by avoiding rollback operations

### 2. At-Most-Once Delivery for MVP

**Decision**: Implement at-most-once delivery guarantee for MVP  
**Rationale**:

- **MVP Scope**: Exactly-once semantics add significant complexity
- **Acceptable Trade-off**: At-most-once is suitable for initial release
- **Implementation Speed**: Faster to implement and test
- **Evolution Path**: Can enhance to exactly-once in future iterations

### 3. No Distributed Transactions

**Decision**: No distributed transaction support or compensation mechanisms  
**Rationale**:

- **Team Decision**: Explicitly confirmed not needed
- **Complexity Reduction**: Avoids distributed transaction complexity
- **Performance**: Better performance without transaction coordination
- **Operational Simplicity**: Easier to operate and debug

### 4. Data Loss Tolerance

**Decision**: Acceptable data loss tolerance, focus on Data Stream Compute SLA  
**Rationale**:

- **Business Acceptance**: Team confirmed data loss tolerance is acceptable
- **SLA Focus**: Prioritize Data Stream Compute service level agreements
- **MVP Pragmatism**: Avoid over-engineering for initial release
- **Monitoring Focus**: Comprehensive monitoring instead of prevention

### 5. Simple Partial Failure Handling

**Decision**: Simple approach for partial failure handling in first iteration  
**Rationale**:

- **Iterative Development**: Start simple, enhance in future iterations
- **Proven Approach**: Log and monitor patterns for operational insights
- **Success Definition**: Return success if any write operation succeeds
- **Alerting Strategy**: Monitor patterns rather than prevent failures

## Process Description

### Finalized Dual-Write Workflow

This diagram describes the **implemented dual-write error handling process**:

1. **Request Reception**: Client sends request with correlation ID
2. **Dual-Write Initiation**: Orchestrator initiates parallel writes to Data Cloud and Index
3. **Independent Execution**: Both writes execute independently without coordination
4. **Result Collection**: System collects responses from both operations
5. **Partial Success Evaluation**: Determine if any write succeeded
6. **Response Generation**: Return success if any write succeeded, error if both failed
7. **Observability**: Log all outcomes with detailed partial success tracking
8. **Retry Handling**: Simple retry for transient errors only
9. **Client Response**: Return appropriate response with partial success information

### Simplified Error Classification

**Three-Category System**:

- **Both Writes Succeed**: Return success response
- **Partial Success**: Return success response with partial success logging
- **Both Writes Fail**: Apply simple retry logic, then return error

## Implementation Specifications

### Partial Success Handler Logic

```typescript
interface WriteResults {
  dataCloudSuccess: boolean;
  indexSuccess: boolean;
  dataCloudError?: Error;
  indexError?: Error;
}

function handleWriteResults(results: WriteResults): Response {
  // Partial success is acceptable - return success if any write succeeded
  if (results.dataCloudSuccess || results.indexSuccess) {
    logPartialSuccess(results);
    return {
      success: true,
      partialSuccess: !(results.dataCloudSuccess && results.indexSuccess),
      details: {
        dataCloud: results.dataCloudSuccess ? "success" : "failed",
        index: results.indexSuccess ? "success" : "failed",
      },
    };
  }

  // Both failed - return error
  return {
    success: false,
    errors: {
      dataCloud: results.dataCloudError,
      index: results.indexError,
    },
  };
}
```

### At-Most-Once Implementation

- **Correlation IDs**: Client-provided correlation IDs for request tracking
- **Simple Deduplication**: Basic duplicate detection with configurable window
- **No Complex Guarantees**: Avoid exactly-once complexity for MVP
- **Retry Logic**: Limited retry attempts with exponential backoff

### Monitoring Enhancements

- **Dual-Write Metrics**: Success rates for each write operation independently
- **Partial Success Tracking**: Specific metrics for partial success scenarios
- **SLA Monitoring**: Focus on Data Stream Compute SLA requirements
- **Pattern Detection**: Monitor partial success patterns for operational insights

## Observability Implementation Details

### Enhanced Structured Logging

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "component": "PartialSuccessHandler",
  "correlationId": "req_12345",
  "transactionId": "txn_67890",
  "event": "partial_success",
  "details": {
    "dataCloudWrite": {
      "success": true,
      "latency": 150,
      "hash": "abc123"
    },
    "indexWrite": {
      "success": false,
      "error": "timeout",
      "latency": 5000
    },
    "overallResult": "success"
  }
}
```

### Key Metrics for Dual-Write

- **Overall Success Rate**: Percentage of requests with at least one successful write
- **Data Cloud Success Rate**: Success rate for Data Cloud writes specifically
- **Index Success Rate**: Success rate for Index writes specifically
- **Partial Success Rate**: Percentage of requests with partial success
- **Dual Success Rate**: Percentage of requests with both writes successful

### Alert Conditions (SLA-Focused)

- **Data Stream Compute SLA**: Monitor alignment with Data Stream Compute service levels
- **High Partial Success Rate**: Alert if partial success rate exceeds threshold
- **Complete Failure Rate**: Alert if both writes fail above threshold
- **Latency Degradation**: Monitor for performance impacts

## Business Impact
