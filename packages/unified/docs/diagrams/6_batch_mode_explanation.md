# Batch Mode Diagram Explanation

## Diagram Overview

This flowchart diagram illustrates the **finalized batching system architecture** for the Unified Data Ingestion SDK/API. It shows how the system handles high-volume data ingestion through a queue-based batching service when `dataCloudWriteMode: "batch"` is specified, providing an optimized alternative to real-time processing.

## What This Diagram Shows

### Batching Decision Flow

The diagram shows how the system **decides between batched and direct processing**:

1. **Client Request**: Application sends data with batching metadata
2. **Rules Processing**: System interprets `dataCloudWriteMode: "batch"`
3. **Batching Decision**: Orchestrator checks if batching is enabled
4. **Route Selection**: Data flows either to batch ingestion service or direct write

### Finalized Queue-Based Architecture

The diagram presents the **selected queue-based implementation** as a separate service:

#### Batch Ingestion Service (Part of Indexing Flow)

- **Implementation**: Separate service using streaming engine (Kafka/NATS)
- **Persistence**: Built-in persistence layer for reliability
- **Processing**: Modified Kafka Streams for stream processing
- **Triggers**: Dual trigger system (window size OR batch size - whichever reached first)
- **Retry**: Simple retry logic (1 batch = 1 payload = 1 transaction)

#### Key Components

1. **Streaming Engine**: Kafka/NATS with persistent storage
2. **Batch Processing Logic**: Dual trigger conditions
3. **Retry System**: Simple failure handling with retries

## Assignment Requirements Addressed

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-2: Metadata-Driven Processing**: Batching activated through metadata specification
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces overhead for high-volume data ingestion
- **Reliability**: Queue-based approach with persistence provides fault tolerance

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: Separate service can scale independently
- **Efficiency**: Dual trigger system optimizes for both latency and throughput
- **Reliability**: Kafka/NATS provides enterprise-grade reliability

### Architecture Requirements

- **Required for MVP**: Batching is now required for the MVP release
- **Separate Service**: Implemented as part of the indexing flow
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing architecture

## Finalized Design Decisions

### 1. MVP Requirement

**Decision**: Batching is required for MVP  
**Rationale**:

- **Business Need**: High-volume use cases require batching from launch
- **Performance**: Critical for meeting throughput requirements
- **User Experience**: Needed to support expected usage patterns

### 2. Queue-Based Implementation Selected

**Decision**: Implement queue-based approach as separate service  
**Rationale**:

- **Reliability**: Kafka/NATS provides enterprise-grade durability
- **Scalability**: Can scale batch processing independently of main flow
- **Monitoring**: Queue depth provides clear observability
- **Industry Standard**: Well-proven pattern for high-volume processing

### 3. Dual Trigger System

**Decision**: Use both window size and batch size triggers  
**Rationale**:

- **Flexibility**: Optimizes for both latency and throughput
- **Predictable Behavior**: Clear trigger conditions
- **Resource Management**: Prevents unbounded memory usage
- **Performance**: Balances efficiency with responsiveness

### 4. Simple Retry Strategy

**Decision**: Implement simple retry logic (1 batch = 1 payload = 1 transaction)  
**Rationale**:

- **Simplicity**: Easier to implement and debug
- **Reliability**: Clear transaction boundaries
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead
- **Existing Solution**: Leverages existing Kafka Streams solution

## Process Description

### Finalized Batching Workflow

This diagram describes the **implemented batching process**:

1. **Request Reception**: Client sends data with `dataCloudWriteMode: "batch"`
2. **Metadata Processing**: Rules Interpreter recognizes batching request
3. **Batching Check**: Orchestrator confirms batching is enabled
4. **Service Routing**: Data flows to Batch Ingestion Service
5. **Queue Storage**: Data stored in persistent message queue (Kafka/NATS)
6. **Stream Processing**: Modified Kafka Streams processes incoming data
7. **Trigger Evaluation**: System checks both window size and batch size conditions
8. **Batch Execution**: When either trigger met, batch sent to Data Cloud SDK
9. **Retry Handling**: Failed batches retried with simple retry logic
10. **Confirmation**: Success confirmations sent back through the flow

### Batch Trigger Configuration

**Dual Trigger System**:

- **Window Size**: Time-based trigger (configurable interval)
- **Batch Size**: Count/size-based trigger (configurable threshold)
- **First Trigger Wins**: Whichever condition reached first triggers the flush
- **Queue Depth Limits**: ~10MB/15min per session (considered "unlimited" for most use cases)

## Implementation Specifications

### Batch Parameters (Finalized)

- **Window Size**: Time-based trigger for maximum latency control
- **Batch Size**: Count/size-based trigger for throughput optimization
- **Queue Depth**: ~10MB/15min per session limit
- **Trigger Logic**: Whichever reached first will trigger the batch flush

### Service Architecture

- **Location**: Separate service as part of indexing flow
- **Technology**: Kafka/NATS streaming engine with persistence
- **Processing**: Modified existing Kafka Streams solution
- **Scaling**: Independent scaling from main ingestion flow

### Failure Handling (Finalized)

- **Strategy**: Simple retries only
- **Transaction Model**: 1 batch = 1 payload = 1 transaction
- **Existing Solution**: Modify existing Kafka Streams-based solution
- **No Complex Recovery**: No compensation or rollback mechanisms

### Monitoring Requirements

- **Standard Monitoring**: Common software monitoring practices
- **Queue Depth**: Monitor batch queue depths
- **Processing Latency**: Track batch processing times
- **Failure Rates**: Monitor retry rates and success rates
- **Throughput Metrics**: Track batching efficiency

## Technical Implementation Details

### Queue-Based Implementation

```typescript
// Client-side usage (unchanged)
const result = await unifiedSDK.writeData(telemetryData, {
  processing: {
    dataCloudWriteMode: "batch",
    indexWriteMode: "realtime",
  },
});

// Batch Ingestion Service Configuration
const batchConfig = {
  windowSize: "15m", // Time-based trigger
  batchSize: 1000, // Count-based trigger
  maxQueueDepth: "10MB", // Per session limit
  retryAttempts: 3, // Simple retry count
  streamingEngine: "kafka", // Kafka/NATS choice
};
```

### Service Integration
